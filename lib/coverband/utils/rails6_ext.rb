# frozen_string_literal: true

###
# This backports routing redirect active notification events to Rails 6
#
# * reproducing this event: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/43755/files
#   * and pulls in the later: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/40dc22f715ede12ab9b7e06d59fae185da2c38c7
# * using alias method although prepend might be an interesting alternative
# * this doesn't backport the built in listener for the event (ActionDispatch::LogSubscriber) as logging isn't needed
